## Course structure

* Each section consists of several relatively self-contained topics, each introduced and summarized by an expert.
* If you have questions about the material, ask them using the discussion right after the final video of each topic.
* The assignments are a combination of numerical simulations, where you evaluate your success on your own (but do share your results), and a review of a paper out of a selection of papers. The reviews are then cross-evaluated by other participants.
* In order to keep everyone on the same page, we set a one week deadline for the assignments (plus an extra week for cross-evaluation of the paper reviews). The questions in the course materials have no deadline.
